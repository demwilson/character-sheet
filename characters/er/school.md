## **Foresight School Abilities**

### **Forewarned** (Su)

You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a Perception roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a +{{pf.level('Diviner', 0.5)}} bonus on initiative checks. At 20th level, anytime you roll initiative, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

### **Prescience** (Su)

At the beginning of your turn, you may, as a free action, roll a single d20. At any point before your next turn, you may use the result of this roll as the result of any d20 roll you are required to make. If you do not use the d20 result before your next turn, it is lost. You can use this ability {{3 + pf.modifier('int') + pf.level('Diviner')}} times per day.
