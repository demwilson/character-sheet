### **Spire Transport Token**

One of the curious properties of the Emerald Spire is that the crystal needle itself can serve as a lightning-swift magical elevator. Those who know the secret of this function can easily move to any level of the Spire by simply touching the crystal column and speaking aloud (or even subvocalizing) the name of the unique rune or identifying the specific level the transporting character wishes to move to. The character is then teleported to a square adjacent to the Spire column on the desired level.

To use Spire transport, a character must do the following:

* Wear or carry a special transport token.
* Know the identifying rune or mark for the level he or she wishes to transport to. $know floor 1-4$
* Use a free action to speak the name of the rune.
* Bring no more than one other creature along (this is the  only way a nonsentient or unconscious character can use Spire transport).

Along with doing all of the above, after using the Spire  transport, a character cannot use it again for 1 hour.
