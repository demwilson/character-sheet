### **Blood Casting** (Su)

The bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. She can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, she can cast and concentrate on only her bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.

### **Blood Sanctuary** (Su)

Due to the power of her blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or her allies. She gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that she or an ally casts.

### **Bloodrage** (Su)

A bloodrager can bloodrage for a {{2+pf.modifier('constitution')+ 2*pf.level('Bloodrager')}} rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear's endurance) don't increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.

A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +3 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A bloodrager can end her bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he's fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, her bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.

### **Breath Weapon** (Su)

You gain a breath weapon that you can use once per day. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of your energy type per bloodrager level. Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The DC of this save is {{10 + pf.level('Bloodrager', 0.5) + pf.modifier('constitution')}}. The shape of the breath weapon depends on your dragon type (as indicated on the above table). At 16th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day.

### **Claws** (Su)

You grow claws. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d6 points of damage each plus your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points. At 12th level, these claws deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of your energy type on a hit.

### **Draconic Resistance** (Ex)

You gain resistance 5 against your energy type and a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. At 8th level, your energy resistance increases to 10 and your natural armor bonus increases to +2. At 16th level, your natural armor bonus increases to +4.

### **Fast Movement** (Ex)

A bloodrager's land speed is faster than is normal for her race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager's speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager's land speed.

### **Improved Uncanny Dodge** (Ex)

A bloodrager can react to danger before her senses would normally allow him to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.

A bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.
