### **Channel Positive Energy** (Su)

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to {{pf.level('Cleric', 0.5)}}d6 points of damage. Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is {{10 + pf.modifier('wisdom') + pf.level('Cleric', 0.5)}}. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point totalâ€”all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy {{1 + pf.modifier('wisdom')}} times per day. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.

## **Luck Domain**

### **Bit of Luck** (Sp)
You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, giving it a bit of luck. For the next round, any time the target rolls a d20, he may roll twice and take the more favorable result. You can use this ability {{3 + pf.modifier('wisdom')}} times per day.

### **Good Fortune** (Ex)
As an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. You can use this ability {{(pf.level('Cleric', 1/6))}} time{{(pf.level('Cleric', 1/6)) > 1 ? 's' : ''}} per day.

## **Travel Domain**

### **Agile Feet** (Su)
As a free action, you can gain increased mobility for 1 round. For the next round, you ignore all difficult terrain and do not take any penalties for moving through it. You can use this ability {{3 + pf.modifier('wisdom')}} times per day.

### **Dimensional Hop** (Sp)
You can teleport up to {{10 * pf.level('Cleric')}} feet per day as a move action. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must have line of sight to your destination to use this ability. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each creature brought.
