### **Inspired Moment** (Ex)

The guide can have an inspired moment {{ pf.level('Ranger') == 19 ? 'twice' : 'once'}} per day as a free action. The Ranger gains the following benefits until the end of her next turn. Her speed increases by 10 feet. She can take an extra move or swift action on her turn. She gains a +4 bonus to AC and on attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks. Finally, she automatically confirms any critical threat she scores.

### **Ranger's Focus** (Ex)

A guide can focus on a single enemy within line of sight as a swift action. That creature remains the Ranger’s focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until the Ranger designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The Ranger gains a +{{2+pf.level('Ranger', 1/5)*2}} bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of her focus. A guide can use this ability {{pf.level('Ranger', 1/3)}} times per day.

### **Ranger's Luck** (Ex)

The guide can either reroll one of her attack rolls or force an enemy who just hit her with an attack to reroll the attack roll. The Ranger must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. You can use this ability {{ pf.level('Ranger') < 14 ? 'once' : pf.level('Ranger') < 19 ? '2 times' : '3 times'}} per day.

### **Terrain Bond** (Ex)

The guide forms a bond with the land itself, enabling her to direct others in such terrain. When in her favored terrain, the Ranger grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear her a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with her, the Ranger’s allies leave no trail and can’t be tracked. The Ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if she so desires.

### **Wild Empathy** (Ex)

A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds her ranger level and her Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.
