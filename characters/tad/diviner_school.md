## **Scyer School**

**Forewarned** (Su): You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a Perception roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a +1 bonus on initiative checks.

**Send Senses** (Sp): As a standard action, you place a scrying sensor at a point within medium range ({{100 + 10 * pf.level('Diviner')}} feet) that you can see and have line of effect to. You can see or hear (not both) through this sensor for 1 round. The sensor otherwise functions as a *clairaudience/clairvoyance* spell with a caster level equal to your wizard level. You can use this ability {{3 + pf.modifier('intelligence')}} times per day.
