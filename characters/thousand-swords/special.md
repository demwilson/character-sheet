### **Forewarned** (Su)

You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a Perception roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a +1 bonus on initiative checks.

### **Mutagen** (Su)

A mutation warrior discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An mutation warrior can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time—if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in a mutation warrior's possession becomes inert until a mutation warrior picks it up again.

When a mutation warrior brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score—either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the mutation warrior to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the mutation warrior takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his Charisma.

A non-mutation warrior who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude save DC {{10 + pf.modifier('intelligence')}} or become nauseated for 1 hour. a non-mutation warrior can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but a mutation warrior can gain the effects of another mutation warrior's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other mutation warrior creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever a mutation warrior drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.

### **Send Senses** (Sp)

As a standard action, you place a scrying sensor at a point within 110 ft. that you can see and have line of effect to. You can see or hear (not both) through this sensor for 1 round. The sensor otherwise functions as a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell of caster level 1. You can use this ability {{3 + pf.modifier('intelligence')}} times per day.
