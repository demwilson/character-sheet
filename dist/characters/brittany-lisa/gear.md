### **Cyclopse Helm** (5,600 gp)
This helm is made from the husk of a cyclops’s shrunken head, and grants a limited version of that creature’s flash of insight ability. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can choose the result of the die roll instead of rolling her next attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check.
