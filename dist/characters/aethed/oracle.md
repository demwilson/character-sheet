## **Oracle's Curse** (Clouded Vision)

Your eyes are obscured, making it difficult for you to see. You cannot see anything beyond 30 feet, but you can see as if you had darkvision.

## **Channel Positive Energy** (Su)

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the oracle. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to {{pf.level('Oracle', 0.5)}}d6 points of damage. Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is {{10 + pf.modifier('charisma') + pf.level('Oracle', 0.5)}}. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point totalâ€”all excess healing is lost. A oracle may channel energy {{1 + pf.modifier('charisma')}} times per day. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A oracle can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.
