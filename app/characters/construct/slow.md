#### **Slow** (Su)

A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on the golem and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 14 Will save to negate. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the golem's hit dice + the golem's Constitution modifier.
