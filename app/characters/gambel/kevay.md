#### **Augmented Criticals** (Su)

The critical threat range of each of Kevay’s Chosen attacks doubles. The doubling follows the standard rules for doubling critical ranges and does not stack with other doubling effects, such as keen edge or the Improved Critical feat.

#### **Lucky Strike** (Su)

As a swift action, once per minute, Kevay’s Chosen can apply a true strike effect to a single attack.

#### **Turn of Fate** (Su)

Once per day, Kevay’s Chosen can reroll any failed roll it has just made. It must accept the results of the second roll.
